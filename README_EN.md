# Data Structures in Hack

Hack is a PHP dialect created by Facebook focused on type robustness and scalability, while maintaining the dynamism of the original language that brings a trade-off of smoother development.

Hack is perfectly interoperable with PHP, and needed to be, as it emerged in a context where PHP was the main language used in Facebook's engines and was beginning to show some technical limitations related to scalability and security. Thus, a gradual transition between technologies was necessary, so as not to impact the operation of the application in production. Interoperability solves this problem.

Hack is executed by HHVM, a JIT virtual machine also created by Facebook that brings the best of both worlds from the main code execution paradigms (interpretation and compilation). HHVM brings the necessary robustness to the language through type checking and validation implementation in program structuring to not allow non-modular code (outside functions or classes), forcing the programmer to organize the code base more carefully.

Below you will find a tutorial on how to initialize a basic Hack project that uses some primitive types and native array types of the language, such as Vector and Dictionary for implementing simple data structures.

There is also a utility type checker that can be used to perform basic checks (verifies errors at build time, such as syntax problems and type inference).

### Requirements

- PHP >= 7.4 (required for composer installation)
- Composer (installed globally)

## Installing HHVM

First of all, you need to install HHVM on your machine. With the instructions below it's possible to perform universal installation on Linux distributions.

```bash
apt-get update 
apt-get install --yes software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xB4112585D386EB94 

add-apt-repository 'deb https://dl.hhvm.com/universal release main' 
apt-get update 
apt-get install hhvm
```

Run the command below to verify that HHVM was installed correctly. The output should be the configured version number.

```bash
hhvm --version
```

## Initializing the Hack Project

Create a directory for the project at your preferred location in your machine's file system, then create a file named `.hhconfig` in the root directory.

```bash
touch .hhconfig
```

Now, download the default .hhconfig provided by the hhvm repository on GitHub.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hhvm/hhast/master/.hhconfig > .hhconfig
```

Or if you prefer, insert them manually (not recommended)

```ini
ignored_paths = [ "tests/examples/NonHackFileTest/php_files/.*", ".*SyntaxExample.*", "vendor/bin" ]
error_php_lambdas = true
disable_xhp_children_declarations = false
allowed_decl_fixme_codes=2053,4045,4047
allowed_fixme_codes_strict=2011,2049,2050,2053,2083,3084,4027,4045,4047,4104,4106,4107,4108,4110,4128,4135,4188,4223,4240,4323,4390,4401
; enable_strict_string_concat_interp=true
```

With the directives configured, let's now proceed to the necessary steps for installing the language's base library and configuring autoload for classes and files.

### Installing File Autoload

Install the Hack file autoload package.

```bash
composer require hhvm/hhvm-autoload
```

Run the command below to create an `hh_autoload.json` file and insert the autoload configurations.

```bash
cat > hh_autoload.json <<EOF
{
  "roots": [
    "src/"
  ],
  "devRoots": [
    "tests/"
  ],
  "devFailureHandler": "Facebook\\AutoloadMap\\HHClientFallbackHandler"
}
EOF
```

Finally, run the command below to generate the autoload files.

```bash 
vendor/bin/hh-autoload
```

### Installing the Hack Standard Library

After installing and configuring autoload, let's proceed to installing the base library, the Hack Standard Library (hsl).

The hhvm/hsl package contains the base library for Hack. It contains utility functions and classes for common development tasks, and in most cases replaces native PHP APIs. With this library, Hack development becomes much more robust and, in practice, this is where most of the advantages of using the language lie, which, with this package, becomes more than a PHP superset.

```bash
composer require hhvm/hsl
```

### Running the Application

You can run a `.hack` file directly through the command line by calling the hhvm binary that is installed at the root of your machine, as shown below:

```
hhvm index.hack
```

There is also a utility type checker that can be used to perform basic checks (verifies errors at build time, such as syntax problems and type inference).

```bash
hh_client
```

### Final Considerations

Have fun.
